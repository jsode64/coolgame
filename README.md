# Project

Our project is a lightweight platform-style fighting game.

It is in the very early stages of development.

# Installation

To install, run the following:
- `cmake -B build`
- `make -C build`

Note that you must have Raylib installed and finable by CMake.

This will put the executable in the `build` directory.
